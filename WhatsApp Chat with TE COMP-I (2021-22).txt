*Logo and Theme of C.E.S.A 2K20.*
 *AISSMS* *IOIT,PUNE-411001*

WE know as a Computer Engineer we have to think about all the technologies mentioned in the logo and our community thinks only about these companies and technologies.  So this is what Computer Engineers can create. Colours in our logo describe our theme and conveys that we are growing in all technical field but we also have to think about Mother Earth.
Our logo also resembles the coexistence of nature and earth.
As we announce our logo for our theme of C.E.S.A 2k20 we take an oath that we will also take care of nature with growing technologies .
The two circuits between  the name shows that any machinery is incomplete without circuit and we are incomplete without machinery. The entire logo describes a general idea about the interdependence and relativity of technologies on each other and their impact in the field.

08/09/20, 15:19 - Minal Nerkar Mam Se Gfm: Dear All,

We hope you are keeping safe in these unprecedented times of CORONA Pandemic.

Himalaya Diwas is an initiative that was started in 2010 by a group of noted environmentalists and activists including Sunder Lal Bahuguna, Anil Joshi and Radha Behan to spread the message that solutions for sustainable development and ecological stability for the Himalayas must be as unique as the Himalayan ecosystem itself. This initiative has been supported by many politicians. Though, the whole hearted support of Sh. Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Minister of Education has been the greatest driving force behind the same.

The Himalayas stretch across the northeastern portion of India. They cover approximately 1,500 mi (2,400 km) and pass through the nations of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Bhutan and Nepal.
The Himalayas is the highest mountain range in the world. It‚Äôs home to 9 out of 10 of the world‚Äôs highest peaks, including Mount Everest.

Himalayas since ages has been source of life supporting resources. Life cannot be imagined without this great entity. It services many Nation directly or indirectly through its water, soil and air impacting lives of 900 billion people .Himalaya is store of 9000 glaciers. These glaciers are the biggest source of river water for approximately 1.3 billion people in India and seven other countries. Almost all the great rivers of India have their sources in the Himalayan ranges. A massive one in five people on Earth depend on the fresh water that flows from the eastern Himalayas. Water isn‚Äôt the only important thing found in the Himalayas. The area is also a treasure trove of biodiversity, home to; over 10,000 types of plant; about 300 mammals; 977 birds; 176 reptiles; 105 amphibians; 269 freshwater fish and large number of invertebrates.


The Himalaya range affects air and water circulation systems, impacting the weather conditions in not only in the nearby regions but whole country. We all owe the air we breathe, water we use and the protection we have to the Himalaya. It contributes massively to Indian economy by farming and developing various agro based industries and at the top through its ecosystem services.


But the Climate change is one of the biggest threats facing the Himalayan ecosystems. the major challenges facing the Himalayas are increasing population, rampant urbanisation, unchecked deforestation, melting of glaciers, construction of roads, establishment of hydroelectric projects etc. Many such activities are being planned and implemented without giving cognizance to the fact that Himachal is an eco-sensitive zone.

After COVID-19 catastrophe, Himalaya need to be understood more as it has averted acute ecological crisis for the Nation. This ecosystem however has shown disability in many ecological fronts yet it has not turn face from us despite our apathetic behaviour.

It is, therefore, this year Himalayan day focus upon ‚ÄúThe Himalaya and Nature‚Äù. In the wake of current pandemic and likely threats, we need to understand this entity for our common future. This year Himalaya Divas is being celebrated at National level. 9th September, 2020 has been earmarked for celebration of 11th Himalaya Divas to bring stakeholder including Government, environmentalists, scientists, politicians, faith leaders etc. to sensitize people about the importance of the subject and to discover how everyone can support in this initiative. The chief guest of the event is our Honourable Vice President of India - Shri M. Venkaiah Naidu .This initiative has been organized under the guidance of our Honourable Minister of Education - Shri Ramesh Pokrihyal Ji (Nishank) and Dr. Anil Prakash Joshi, Padam Bhusan, Environmentalist.



To be part of this event , you can join through the below link:

We look forward to your participation in the event and support the initiative further.

Greetings from All India Council for technical education...!

In reference to our earlier mail on the above-mentioned subject The link for the web telecast of the said symposium and exhibition is as given below:

    LINK: https://webcast.gov.in/moc/nmi 

A two-day, National Symposium on 'Memories of 22 October 1947' is being organized by the National Museum Institute of History of Art, Conservation and Museology, New Delhi in SKICC, Srinagar, Kashmir on 22-23 Oct 2020. The symposium will be accompanied by an exhibition on 'Invasion by Pakistan ofKashmir' at the same venue.

The aim of the symposium and exhibition is to bring forth the historical narrative of the events sparked off by the Pakistan backed invasion by the Afghan Tribal Militia on 22 Oct 1947 and to bring about awareness among the people about this phase of our history. Recalling the violence and atrocity of invaders and valour displayed in overcoming this challenge will be a tribute to the people who laid down their lives in the first battle of independent India, the symposium and exhibition proposes to outline shapes and contours of a future museum on this theme.

In view of the above, AICTE requests your institute to disseminate this information among all students & faculty members to join and hear the symposium virtually and view the online exhibition. 

With Regards,

AICTE

26/03/21, 13:59 - +91 74200 38129: ACM India Education Webinar on 27 March with Neeran Karnik: "Cloud-Native Computing"


The next session of the ACM India Webinar Series on Education is on on Cloud-Native Computing, another interesting and important topic for students as the adoption of cloud has become increasingly prevalent in most of the business and IT organizations during the past decade.

Register now for "Cloud-Native Computing", to be presented on Saturday 27 March 2021 at 5:30 pm IST by Neeran M. Karnik.

Registrations are limited, so please register early and secure your spot. All educators, academicians, industry professionals and students are welcome to attend the webinar. Feel free to forward this communication to those who would be interested.

Note : You can also stream this webinar on your mobile device, including smartphone and tablet.

Duration : 60 minutes (including audience Q&A)

Abstract: Cloud-native Computing is a modern approach to software development in which the application is architected from scratch "for the cloud." This influences the application's design, implementation, deployment as well as operations.

This talk will give an overview of cloud-native computing, its historical context, and several building blocks such as microservices architecture, containerization, clusters and service meshes. Microservices enable us to design and develop the application as a set of autonomous, loosely-coupled modules communicating over standard protocols. Open-source tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Envoy and Istio facilitate the deployment, orchestration, monitoring and control of cloud applications at runtime. Finally, we will consider how such cloud-native applications can be hosted on public as well as private clouds, and the tradeoffs involved.

Presenter:
Neeran M. Karnik is a researcher and software architect, with interests in areas like distributed systems, cloud computing and security. He obtained a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota, with a thesis in the area of mobile agent security. He has worked in large organizations like IBM, Veritas and BMC Software, as well as startups like CricInfo (where he was a co-founder), Vuclip and Tarana Wireless. He has also taught courses at University of Minnesota and IIT-Delhi. Neeran has published 20+ peer-reviewed papers in conferences and journals, and holds 25 US patents.

16/05/21, 18:12 - +91 98233 28686: Dear Coordinator, 

Greetings. 

There is currently an acute shortage of medical grade oxygen in large parts of the country, as a consequence of a big surge in the number of critical Covid-19 cases, as well as logistical challenges associated with the oxygen supply chain. Several past and current students and research staff members of IIT Bombay (affiliated with Tata Centre for Technology and Design, Chemical Engineering, and Nex Robotics) have come together to attempt solutions which focus on reducing O2 wastage, from the patient consumption perspective.

We have built a prototype breathing device called reBreather , which can minimize the wastage of oxygen when a patient is put on assisted breathing with supplemental oxygen via O2 cylinders or centralised O2 supply in hospitals. Our reBreather prototype is a semi-closed circular breathing system that would allow patients to breathe in unused exhaled oxygen which has been filtered to remove CO2.

The hardware design is available in the public domain under the Creative Commons 4.0 license (CC BY-SA 4.0) so that others can replicate the design. We urge individuals and makers communities across the world to come forward and

help assemble copies of the prototype, and
contribute design improvements or customizations, including for better scalability.
This design has currently been tested on healthy volunteers: our objective in releasing this design now is to document the science behind the technique and test that it works in a practical context, and potentially help mitigate wastage of O2 at a time when there is a heavy demand for it.

We have added explanations on how the reBreather works and on how to build a unit, with detailed pictures and instructions. Vendor and pricing details of the parts we have used in this design have also been provided. We have sourced these with relative ease in Mumbai; you may find cheaper - and better - alternatives for these items. Feel free to let us know if there are ways by which you can help us in improving the design or documentation, or with better vendor connections.

https://github.com/TCTD-IIT-Bombay/reBreather

Wishing you safe and healthy days ahead.

By accepting each other‚Äôs differences, we can move past our selfish nature and work for the greater good in this world. The purpose behind celebrating International Day of Yoga is to unite the entire human race to live an abundant life. May this day create a change in you that can create a change in this world.

26/06/21, 10:09 - Anuradha Mam(CG): Born on 26th June 1874, Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj  pursued his primary education from Rajkot, Gujrat. After becoming a king at the age of merely 20 years, he consciously exposed himself to outside influences and especially the modern European ideals of democracy, fraternity and individual liberty. Even here, he interacted with prominent rationalists and reformists. Shahu Chhatrapati travelled extensively in Europe and India, absorbed all that he could, and implemented many of those things in Kolhapur. He was a way ahead of his time and promoted need of education in all sections of society. He made primary education free for all and built many hostels to make education easily accessible to all. Compulsory Primary Education Act of 1917 is shows his vision for the future. In 1917 Rajarshi Chatrapati Shahu Maharaj established first AISSM Society, which has become a huge family of educational institutes now, providing education to all parts of the society. We offer our tremendous gratitude towards him for showing all of us the path of inclusive development on the occasion of his birth anniversary!

11/07/21, 09:06 - Anuradha Mam(CG): The current population of the world has reached the mark of 7.87 billion people. The growing population is increasing the consumption of resources like land, water, and energy. The depleting resources are causing harmful fluctuations in the climate. This makes it difficult for the planet to sustain itself in the long run. On account of World Population Day, AISSMS Institute expresses the need to promote advanced family planning measures that can help us stabilize the global population.

09/08/21, 18:13 - Wagh Sir(OOP): Dear Madam/Sir,
¬†
Greetings!
¬†
We are happy to invite your institution to participate in¬†TCS Sustainathon¬†which is getting launched on¬†August 15, 2021¬†for¬†Pune based students.¬† TCS Sustainathon provides a platform for young minds to envision a¬†sustainable future¬†and solve real world problems by leveraging¬†digital technologies.
¬†
TCS launched¬†Sustainathon Singapore in 2020¬†(https://www.tcs-sustainathon.com/), an initiative to inspire and empower young minds to solve real-world environmental problems through technology. The challenge statement for the TCS Sustainathon at Singapore was around combating food wastage and we had Sodexo, the People‚Äôs Association Youth Movement (PAYM), and Singapore Airlines as the Challenge Partners.
¬†
Encouraged by the positive outcomes of the inaugural edition of TCS Sustainathon at Singapore,¬†TCS Pune plans to replicate the same at Pune.¬†The theme chosen for TCS Sustainathon at Pune is ‚ÄúWaste Management‚Äù.¬†
¬†
In June 2021, TCS made an announcement to achieve Net-Carbon-Neutrality by 2030. Leading by example, TCS Pune plans to encourage its surrounding ecosystem to move in this direction and become future ready. This is in line with the larger TCS vision of ‚ÄúBuilding on Belief‚Äù.¬† The upcoming Sustainathon will be a concrete step in this direction. We did a soft launch of the event in Pune on 30th¬†June 2021 to coincide with Tata Sustainability month. (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6815794181932363776/)
¬†
TCS is collaborating with Pune International Centre (PIC), Pune Knowledge Cluster (PKC) and the IEEE Pune Section as strategic partners.¬† All of them share our concern for the environment and are working towards driving the carbon neutrality agenda at a Pune level.¬†We feel that several ingredients are already in place to make this project a success. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Adar Poonawala Clean City Initiative (APCCI), SWACH NGO have given their consent to be the Challenge Partners. The Challenge Partners will be sharing real waste management challenges faced by them and will help deploy appropriate and deserving ideas on waste management in the field. The Sustainathon platform will act as a funnel for crowd sourcing of ideas from the students of Pune. We plan to formally launch the event on 15th¬†August at the hands of noted Indian scientist, Padma Vibhushan¬†Dr R.A Mashelkar.
¬†
Attached herewith is document providing overview of TCS Sustainathon. Further details will be shared on¬†the¬†website going live on 15th¬†August 2021. We request you to encourage maximum participation from your institute.¬†
¬†
More details will be shared on the website going live on 15th¬†August 2021. ¬†¬†

Journey of sportsman which starts from nothing and reaches to the point where he/she wins medals is never easy. Their stories inspire us to give our best in whatever walk of life we are working in.

16/09/21, 17:05 - Amrapali Chavan Mam: Invitation to Webinar organised to celebrate 2 yrs of Chandrayaan-2 in Lunar Orbit : ‡§Ü‡•õ‡§æ‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§Æ‡•É‡§§ ‡§Æ‡§π‡•ã‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡§µ @SAC_Programme 17-Sep-2021 , 10:30 to 1230

Entire nation is celebrating 75 years of Independent India, ‡§Ü‡•õ‡§æ‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§Æ‡•É‡§§ ‡§Æ‡§π‡•ã‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡§µ during 2021-22. Space Applications Centre is organising a Webinar, ‚ÄòExploring our Neighbourhood beyond Planet Earth‚Äô  to commemorate completion of 2 years of Chandrayaan-2 in Lunar orbit, a very important space exploration milestone of India‚Äôs independence as part of ‡§Ü‡•õ‡§æ‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§Ö‡§Æ‡•É‡§§ ‡§Æ‡§π‡•ã‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡§µ. The event is being organised in collaboration with Gujarat Council on Science & Technology that has a very wide outreach in academia and students across the country.

 

Space Applications Centre has the proud privilege to contribute in the key activities towards various planetary programmes of ISRO, right from planetary sensors, data processing and science & applications related to planetary data.

 

I am delighted to inform that Shri A S Kiran Kumar, Chairman, Apex Science Board; former Chairman ISRO and former Secretary DOS, who pioneered planetary activities at Space Applications Centre has kindly agreed to inaugurate the webinar. We are also fortunate to have Prof. Pankaj Joshi, an internationally acclaimed cosmologist and Founding Director, International Centre for Cosmology, Charusat University as our Keynote speaker for the webinar.

 

This webinar is our humble attempt to provide an insight in to what goes in to designing and fabricating sensors onboard planetary missions, the complexity involved in processing the feeble signals received from planetary missions to interpretable images and finally what all do we infer from these images by understanding the physics of interaction of electromagnetic waves with planetary objects.

 

I am very happy to invite you along with your colleagues/fellow researchers/students to participate in this webinar and give wide publicity to the event for the benefit of all. We also request you to kindly share the attached flyer providing the programme details and web link, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v05fn3W_Md0, on your centre/institute/University‚Äôs website/Social media.

 

Looking forward to wide participation!

Subject: Inviting Participation in AADHAAR HACKATHON 2021

Dear IIC Member,
Please circulate the following information with your students and faculties.

India is celebrating ‚ÄúAzadi ka Amrit Mahotsav‚Äù to mark the 75th year of Independence. Coinciding with this auspicious occasion, Aadhaar is moving to the next decade of its existence, with a renewed objective to further improvise resident experience. To celebrate this occasion, UIDAI is hosting a Hackathon targeted at young innovators - who are still at various Engineering institutes and eager to step into the real world. The hackathon is starting on 28 Oct 21 at 0000Hrs and will continue till 31 Oct 21 up to 2300Hrs.

The Hackathon is organized under two broad themes - ‚ÄúAuthentication reimagined‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnhanced enrolment experience‚Äù. Under these two broad themes, five problem statements have been curated by the Aadhaar team - which reflects a few of the challenges being faced by the residents. Detailed problem statements have been released at https://hackathon.uidai.gov.in.

Out of 5 problem statements, teams may choose to solve any of the problems to confirm their participation. The solution must be innovative and must be backed by the demonstrable working code to address the challenge being faced by the residents. Hackathon comes with rewarding cash prizes to celebrate the work of the winning team. Each theme carries the following cash rewards:-

First Prize	3,00,000
Second Prize	2,00,000
Third Prize	1,00,000 For Two teams
In addition, the winning team members may get an opportunity to work with Aadhaar through campus placement to build the next-generation identity and authentication platform, subject to fulfilment of other terms and conditions.

So, come and participate in the first-ever Hackathon hosted by the UIDAI team. For further details and registration of the teams, please visit https://hackathon.uidai.gov.in. Hurry up as the registration is going to close on 25 Oct 21 at 2300Hrs.

05/12/21, 14:41 - +91 97666 44429: Respected Sir/madam,
         This message is regarding the offline submission issues that students are facing. Submissions to be offline are not feasible for each and everyone of us. Since we are currently placed in different states and cities hence we aren't able to come back in Pune even if we want to, Parents of us students are hesitant to allow us to travel all the way to college. There are no living facility or hostels avaipable at the present moment to many. Also many students who are not having 2 doses of Covid vaccine are not comfortable to migrate to Pune due to risk of new covid variant.

We request for a solution of the problem us students are facing.

Hope College will kindly understand our situation.
