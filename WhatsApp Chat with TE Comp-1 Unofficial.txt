The previously forwarded message was due to the demand of fellow ioitians and seniors.

THIS IS STRICTLY DONE BY STUDENTS AND PLEASE DO SUPPORT. If you are in it please drop your suggestions. Kindly spread the word.

10/07/20, 00:09 - +91 95955 26856: Hello folk, 

To all the IOITians,

You all know that we are facing a very crucial situation amids this COVID crises. Many of your parents have undergone salary cuts, losses in business etc. 

As we all may have recieved msg from college portal regarding payment of fees for the academic year, 

We student co-ordinators from all departments, *Urge* you all *Not to pay fees* unless and until compulsion is made.


*We from our end are trying level best to get compensations / increased installments in fees*, keeping in mind the scenario. 

For this to achive we need your support by not paying the fees unless the college favours some of our needs as well. 

*Remeber: Every penny earned is earned by struggle and now is the time to save it*

So we request to please co-operate, we will surely find a way out of it with benefits to students.


Thanks and Regards

26/07/20, 18:29 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: if statement n+1 time execute hoga na
26/07/20, 18:29 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: and return ka step count 1
26/07/20, 18:29 - +91 70580 11691: Haa...
26/07/20, 18:29 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: toh total n+2 aayega
26/07/20, 18:29 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: and else ka return step count 1
26/07/20, 18:30 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: so in total it should be n+3???
26/07/20, 18:30 - +91 70580 11691: Else ki baad ka return ki value phir 1 ayegi. A
26/07/20, 18:30 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: thats what im saying
26/07/20, 18:30 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: poora total
26/07/20, 18:30 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: see  i'll send u this

26/07/20, 18:31 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: The time complexity of an algorithm is basically how many operations are necessary to compute it. While for nonrecursive algorithms the reasoning is quite straight-forward, for recursive algorithms, it is a little tricker, but still easy to follow.

Let's take a simple example, the recursive algorithm to compute the factorial of a natural number n as in the C language code below.

int Factorial(int n) {
  if (n == 0)
    return 1;
  else
    return n*Factorial(n-1);
}
First, we compute how many operations there are in a basic call, in this example, it will be 3 operations:

one for the if condition (is n equal to 0?)
one for the product of n by the output of the next call of Factorial()
one to subtract 1 from n in the parameter of the next call of Factorial()
Therefore, calling T(n) the time complexity of the factorial recursive program above, it will be expressed recursively as:


t_complex_fact

Deriving it to a general case, and considering that T(0) = 1, the time complexity becomes an expression of order n.


t_complex_fact_O

Remeber that the Big Oh means: what really matters in this equation is. For this particular case, it means that the time complexity to compute the factorial of n is a function of n. A complexity like this one is said to be linear since it is directly proportional to the parameter n.
26/07/20, 18:31 - +91 70580 11691: Look at 1.6 algo
26/07/20, 18:32 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: wahan pe atleast define kiya hai s=0
26/07/20, 18:32 - +91 74200 38129: Return statement ke vajah se confusion hai
26/07/20, 18:33 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: yaha prob me naiye waisa

26/07/20, 18:33 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: aah....
26/07/20, 18:34 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: but if statement ka n+2 aara
26/07/20, 18:34 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: uska kya?
26/07/20, 18:34 - +91 70580 11691: If ka n+1 aye ga na
26/07/20, 18:34 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: and uske neeche return hai na
26/07/20, 18:34 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: jiska step count 1 aayega
26/07/20, 18:35 - +91 70580 11691: Kuch samaj nahi aa raha hai

28/07/20, 11:18 - +91 96077 56020: Yes
29/07/20, 21:16 - +91 70580 11691: Hii guys...This is regarding the time table for our online lectures..
There are several issues that students are facing during the lectures,such as
1.Network issues (lagging)
2.Lack of proper environment to concentrate on the lectures
3.Long hours of one subject increasing the screentime,and loss of interest in the subject
4.Health issues such as headache, swelled eyes, irritation in eyes,neck pain due to screentime and using earphones
5.Lack of proper material to understand
6.limited internet package

But,we can solve this if there were a revised time table,with following updates-
1.Max.3 hours per day
2. 30-40minutes per lecture
3. No afternoon or evening lectures..i.e. lectures should be arranged between 8-12.. with one 15min break overall

If you agree please spread the word so that we can make the changes

01/08/20, 18:13 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: *🔴 Important for AISSMS COLLEGE students :*

*AISSMS COLLEGE ABVP Unit 🚩🇮🇳*

Entire economy has fallen due to covid - 19 while subsequent monetary hardships are on rise, so is the decline in the sources of pay for each family unit.

In this extreme time it isn't feasible for everybody to arrange such huge amount of academic fees. Likewise because of prevailing conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic access is confined to banks in numerous territories, and the independently employed business are additionally confronting hardships with overseeing finances.

The vulnerability of lock down keeps on being principle obstacle in money restoration efforts for a large portion of the guardians of students. Therefore *AISSMS COLLEGE ABVP Unit* has taken the following steps in order to cope up with student issues :

*If you agree with this, please sign this petition and send it to your friends in AISSMS :*
https://forms.gle/4uQyAvFHrBkN1Ti48

*1. The exam fee of last semester(even sem 2019-20)* has been paid by all the students but due to the covid-19 pandemic exams were cancelled.
We haven't yet got the information regarding refund of the fee or reuse of it in the up-going semester.

*2. As the lectures are conducted online* and we students don't use the resources at the college like library, electricity, etc. Therefore we consider only paying the Tuition fee, University fees/ E-Seva, and exam fees, all the other fees, student activity fee, development fee, are requested not to collect this year considering the economic crisis.

*3. As students won't be using the hostel facility* for a major portion of the year, we also request to deduce hostel fee and consider taking hostel fee only for the months students will reside in hostel.

*4. We AISSMS COLLEGE ABVP Unit request* college administration to reduce the unwanted fees upto 40% of actual fees paid last year. 

*5. After deduction of fees, college administration should provide facility* to pay the fees in three (3) installment for upcoming academic year 2020-21. Also college must provide the details of three (3) installments in which college administration should mention time span with percentages % throughout the year. 

*If you agree with this, please sign this petition and send it to your friends.*

*Logo and Theme of C.E.S.A 2K20.*
 *AISSMS* *IOIT,PUNE-411001*

WE know as a Computer Engineer we have to think about all the technologies mentioned in the logo and our community thinks only about these companies and technologies.  So this is what Computer Engineers can create. Colours in our logo describe our theme and conveys that we are growing in all technical field but we also have to think about Mother Earth.
Our logo also resembles the coexistence of nature and earth.
As we announce our logo for our theme of C.E.S.A 2k20 we take an oath that we will also take care of nature with growing technologies .
The two circuits between  the name shows that any machinery is incomplete without circuit and we are incomplete without machinery. The entire logo describes a general idea about the interdependence and relativity of technologies on each other and their impact in the field.

23/09/20, 12:43 - +91 90968 28823: Abstract

Artificial neural networks (ANN) are computational machines inspired by the biological central nerve response system. A neuron in an ANN known as perceptron processes an input signal only if its strength reaches a preset threshold. The ANN comprise of an interconnection network of neurons organized into several layers coupled with a learning rule to update the connection rules transforms a given input signal into the desired output. In recent times, there has been a resurgence in ANN research with the advent of Boltzmann Learning Machine, Cognitron, Neocognitron and the Deep Neural Networks. The Complex-Valued, Spiking, and Evolutionary ANNs have shown promising results in real-life applications and decision making. The learning objectives include training in basic theory including practice on ANN models and their variants using Python.

My friend, Ashoi Dantra is a world class supermodel who is sharing her own experience of the modelling world via the graphy app.
She'll inform you about everything that goes around over there, from behind the scenes and on the stage.
You'll learn how to pack a bag like a model and will essentially be ready incase you ever decide to do a glamorous photoshoot.
I ask for your help in subscribing to her channel on graphy, for this is something she's just started and the subscription is at a minimal cost of Rs. 499 /-
If you subscribe you'll get access to the audio video files (duh!) where she uploads a new file every week for a total of 12 episodes, And if you subscribe fast, you'll be able to attend a zoom call with the beautiful miss Ashoi Dantra where she will answer any and all questions you might have for her. I hope you're as excited and thrilled as I am. 
Subscribe now!
The link to do so is as follows

11/08/21, 22:56 - +91 99233 42020: Message by Neha ma'am
11/08/21, 22:56 - +91 99233 42020: 📌1 to 2 month internship program hai(starting not yet know as soon as data us given they will start )
📌No stipend ,no fees
📌Only 5 to 6 will be selected
       *(Resume shortlist and short interview)*
📌 Flexible Working mode (home/office) office location: banner
12/08/21, 07:37 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Just putting it out there, 
HCI needs a pre-requisute knowledge of CG and SE

And IOT needs pre-requisute of only computer network.

Select accordingly.
12/08/21, 07:39 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Ab jitne logo ne CG nahi kiya tha unko HCI difficult jayega.
12/08/21, 07:42 - Aditya Aissms: True
12/08/21, 07:44 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: IOT ke liye jo pre requisite chahiye (computer network and security)
Wo waise bhi iss sem me compulsory subject haim
12/08/21, 07:44 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Hai**
12/08/21, 08:24 - +91 99233 42020: IOT me bohot jaada ratta marna padega. Jaise microprocessor tha vaise hi hoga IOT
HCI me comparatively kam ratta marna padega. Concepts simple hote hai HCI me
12/08/21, 08:41 - Aditya Aissms: IOT me unit 1 he MP jaisa hai bak sab Networking se related hai 
Just saying
12/08/21, 08:44 - swapnil aissms computer 1st: Mere hisab se lot hi best rehega
12/08/21, 08:47 - Prarthana Aissms: I think ek baar previous batch se bhi puch lete how was their experience with IOT.
12/08/21, 08:53 - Harsh Shah: I asked couple of seniors of our clg 
They all said go with iot
12/08/21, 09:22 - Kaustubh Kabra: Because they were not having HCI and DS...
12/08/21, 09:32 - Prarthana Aissms: Yes. They didn't have electives.
12/08/21, 09:34 - Prarthana Aissms: I asked some of the seniors just now. They're saying that we can opt IOT if we really have interest in it. Else SPM is scoring and easy to study so we should go with SPM.
12/08/21, 09:34 - Prarthana Aissms: I have discussed with other juniors and I have recommended SPM to go for.
12/08/21, 09:34 - Prarthana Aissms: IoT is okay and you should go for it if many have pure interest in it. SPM is easyscoring , quite helpful for software development.
12/08/21, 09:35 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: You have a point there
12/08/21, 09:36 - vincent comp 1st: Is anyone interested in DS ?
12/08/21, 09:37 - vincent comp 1st: Just asking is there any problem with it
12/08/21, 09:37 - vincent comp 1st: Uska bhi prerequisite CN hai
12/08/21, 09:37 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Votes were the least for this.
It's a little tacky ....DS
12/08/21, 09:37 - vincent comp 1st: Ohk NP
12/08/21, 09:38 - vincent comp 1st: Im ok with anything u guys decide
12/08/21, 09:38 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: I'm okay with IOT or HCI.

SPM also might work fine I'm not sure.
But mostly IOT or HCI
12/08/21, 09:39 - vincent comp 1st: I think we should ask who is teaching particular elective as a bad teacher can be worse than any subject 😂
12/08/21, 09:39 - Onasvee Banarse: I am ok with any subject just we should not have same teacher .
12/08/21, 09:39 - vincent comp 1st: HCI ke liye Varal mam hai tho plz dont take it 😰
12/08/21, 09:39 - Onasvee Banarse: Not that Dm teacher
12/08/21, 09:39 - +91 95888 85935: Go with HCI it's better for comp IoT is better for entc as it concerns hardware
12/08/21, 09:39 - vincent comp 1st: Ya exactly
12/08/21, 09:40 - Onasvee Banarse: 😂😂 she will just say 
ok ok  yess yess please answer
12/08/21, 09:40 - vincent comp 1st: Next sem ke electives ko bhi dekh lete just
12/08/21, 09:40 - vincent comp 1st: Any prerequisites then we will have lesser options next sem
12/08/21, 09:43 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: For the next sem we have

Information security
(Pre-req : computer networks)

Augmented and VR
(Pre-req : CG)

Cloud computing
(Pre-req : network security and DS)

Software modelling and architecture
(Pre-req : OOP and SE)
12/08/21, 09:43 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Now you don't have to refer pdf baar baar
12/08/21, 09:43 - vincent comp 1st: See if we take any of IOT HCI or SpM we cant take cloud computing
12/08/21, 09:44 - vincent comp 1st: I everyone is ok with it then lets ruleout DS completely
12/08/21, 09:44 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Should work fine.
12/08/21, 09:48 - +91 70580 11691: I also get suggestions of iot from senior
And he says if you wanted to work on front end then u should choose Hci otherwise go with iot
12/08/21, 09:48 - Prarthana Aissms: This message was deleted
12/08/21, 09:49 - Prarthana Aissms: Take IOT only if you really are interested and want to study further in it.
12/08/21, 09:52 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: The only thing I'm worried about is that IOT has electronics
12/08/21, 09:53 - Prarthana Aissms: Yes and uske like achhe se padhna padega. You cannot just learn it and put it on the paper. You'll have to study the concepts properly.
12/08/21, 09:53 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Yes. Iot ke chakkar me kahi back na lagg jaye
12/08/21, 09:54 - +91 99233 42020: Hana
SPM me sabse kam padhna padega
12/08/21, 09:55 - +91 84212 56441: Ok
12/08/21, 09:55 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: I asked a friend who's a software engineer
12/08/21, 09:55 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: <Media omitted>
12/08/21, 09:56 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: If you want to get into a niche field I think you should go for HCI - Human computer interface as you can even later apply to Microsoft research
12/08/21, 09:59 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: This message was deleted
12/08/21, 10:04 - Onasvee Banarse: So should  we have poll again ?
12/08/21, 10:04 - +91 77096 34674: Yes
12/08/21, 10:05 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: It'll again show similar responses.

Hardly 4-5 people are invested in the discussion
12/08/21, 10:05 - Onasvee Banarse: But this time every one take it seriously 😅
12/08/21, 10:05 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Productive outcome aayega kya?
12/08/21, 10:06 - Onasvee Banarse: Compared to last time we have more people discussing on it
12/08/21, 10:06 - Onasvee Banarse: 😅😅
12/08/21, 10:06 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: But almost everyone's confused between min 2 subjects
12/08/21, 10:06 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Toh poll me vote kisko karna hai?
12/08/21, 10:07 - Onasvee Banarse: We can have keep like second preference
12/08/21, 10:07 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Alright. Sounds better
12/08/21, 10:08 - Onasvee Banarse: And according to half of student have already just selected some subject yesterday
12/08/21, 10:08 - Onasvee Banarse: 😅 without even thinking
12/08/21, 10:08 - +91 70580 11691: How many have not selected any subject in that Google form..
12/08/21, 10:09 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: F
12/08/21, 10:09 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: But we can submit multiple responses
12/08/21, 10:09 - Onasvee Banarse: See if the subject were on individual opinions then there is no problem 
But now these subject is for whole class so .
12/08/21, 10:09 - Onasvee Banarse: 😂 we can ?
12/08/21, 10:09 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Absolutely!!
12/08/21, 10:10 - Onasvee Banarse: 😂😂😂 just do that then
12/08/21, 10:10 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Well.... Vote for all subjects😂
12/08/21, 10:11 - Onasvee Banarse: 😂 wow 
Atleast teacher should spend some time creating that forms
12/08/21, 10:12 - Kaustubh Kabra: 😂😂
12/08/21, 10:12 - Aditya Aissms: we can create a form with 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th preferences
12/08/21, 10:13 - Onasvee Banarse: Let it be 2
12/08/21, 10:13 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: I actually have an idea...

There are books mentioned in the PDF 
Of a particular subject

So if you're confused between HCI and IOT...

Why not read atleast 1st chapter of each subject
Just to see if you're understanding anything or not
12/08/21, 10:13 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: 👀👀
12/08/21, 10:14 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: I mean, if y'all are willing to spend 30 mins.

It'll hardly take 30 mins

19/08/21, 08:51 - +91 88052 49671: Abhi b waqt hai.. IOT change karo..
19/08/21, 08:51 - Kaustubh Kabra: She only send form to grp
19/08/21, 08:51 - +91 88052 49671: Isko boldete apne ko chahiye wo
19/08/21, 08:52 - +91 74200 38129: Ye log HCI nahi sikhanyge kyuki inko kuch knowledge nahi aisa second shift ko sadafule sir ne bataya
19/08/21, 08:53 - Prarthana Aissms: Mam ko bole kya ki har subject thoda brief me introduce kara do? Usse apne ko bhi thoda idea aa jayega mam konsa subject achhe se padhayegi
19/08/21, 08:53 - Onasvee Banarse: Which subject they have ?
19/08/21, 08:54 - Kaustubh Kabra: Ye mam abhi subject decide karegi chat me  form gaya khade me 🤦‍♂️
19/08/21, 08:54 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Arey ye aurat software project management bol rahi hai
19/08/21, 08:55 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Usse accha toh for IOT hai
19/08/21, 08:55 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Fir**
19/08/21, 08:55 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Kam se kam placements me toh kaam ayega
19/08/21, 08:55 - +91 74200 38129: They all decided to take either DS or Software management
19/08/21, 08:55 - Prarthana Aissms: Nahi nahi kon bola
19/08/21, 08:55 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Bruh no
19/08/21, 08:56 - Prarthana Aissms: Apne previous batch wale seniors bhi spm bolre the. Coz it's easy to study
19/08/21, 08:56 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Yaar boring subject hai tbh
Poora theory hai
19/08/21, 08:56 - +91 74200 38129: Yes isliye second shift wale bhi ye subject le rahe hai
19/08/21, 08:56 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: IOT me skillset toh milega
19/08/21, 08:57 - Prarthana Aissms: See, iot will get more difficult to study coz khud se padhna hai
19/08/21, 08:57 - +91 88052 49671: tu hi boli thi IOT matt lo
19/08/21, 08:57 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Spm se toh better hi hai na
19/08/21, 08:57 - Prarthana Aissms: Jisko iot me interest hai usko hi kaam aata hai iot
19/08/21, 08:58 - Kaustubh Kabra: Ye pura theory he ratta nahi mare jata
19/08/21, 08:58 - +91 74200 38129: Teacher shayad easy subject dekhenge
19/08/21, 08:58 - Onasvee Banarse: I guess 
Whole sem we will just look at chat box
19/08/21, 08:59 - +91 74200 38129: Aur first and second shift ko same subject hone wala hai
19/08/21, 08:59 - Kaustubh Kabra: 😂😂😂
19/08/21, 08:59 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: <Media omitted>
19/08/21, 08:59 - +91 77096 34674: You can study iot on any other platform simultaneously keeps academics easy guys....spm easy hai to why not choose that
19/08/21, 08:59 - +91 74200 38129: Aur second shift ko bola hai ki SPM or IOT se select karo
19/08/21, 08:59 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Pehle toh sab IOT bol rahe the???
19/08/21, 09:00 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: jab poll liya tha tab
19/08/21, 09:00 - Prarthana Aissms: Exactly. Jinko aage bhi IOT padhna hoga unko hi kaam aayega ye subject. Baaki logo ke liye it'll only be a burden to study
19/08/21, 09:00 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Votes toh IOT ko mile the???
Spm kaise decide ho raha hai?
19/08/21, 09:01 - +91 77096 34674: Tbh meine to randomly dala tha 😂
19/08/21, 09:01 - +91 74200 38129: Yahi 2 option available hai
19/08/21, 09:01 - Onasvee Banarse: Out or 80 to 90 student only 32 voted in unofficial poll
19/08/21, 09:01 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Fuck?
19/08/21, 09:01 - Prarthana Aissms: Coz everyone is confused
19/08/21, 09:01 - +91 77096 34674: I'm not saying that IOT will not do any good. But academics easy hoga toh sabko benefit hoga naa
19/08/21, 09:02 - +91 99233 42020: +1
19/08/21, 09:04 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Valid enough
19/08/21, 09:04 - +91 88052 49671: True
19/08/21, 09:05 - Onasvee Banarse: So DS or SE
19/08/21, 09:05 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: SE lelo 
DS se better hai
19/08/21, 09:05 - Onasvee Banarse: Same option as shift 2
19/08/21, 09:05 - +91 99233 42020: Aise bhi college valo se kuch samajhta hai nai
IOT leke bhi kya karoge 
End me khud hi karna hai 
To better hai na ki khud se kisi aur course me se kar de
College ke syllabus se to jaada hi seekhoge
19/08/21, 09:06 - +91 99233 42020: And elective ke liye koi simple subject select karte jo padhne me jaada load nai aayega
19/08/21, 09:07 - +91 77096 34674: Exactly
19/08/21, 09:08 - Onasvee Banarse: So SPM if final from MAAM
19/08/21, 09:08 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Yep.
19/08/21, 09:08 - Kaustubh Kabra: Important nahi lagta ya padhne nahi aata
19/08/21, 09:09 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Bruh lmaooo
19/08/21, 09:11 - Kaustubh Kabra: Ds lelo fir spm nahi

19/08/21, 09:12 - +91 70580 11691: Guys...mam kuch decide karke direct hume boli isse phele ek sub decide karo...
19/08/21, 09:12 - Aditya Aissms: DS cloud Computing ke liye sahi hai
19/08/21, 09:12 - vincent comp 1st: Yes
19/08/21, 09:13 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Kabhi IOT bolte ho

Fir sab spm bol rahe the

Ab DS le rahe ho


Kya hai yeh?
19/08/21, 09:13 - +91 75073 85028: +1
19/08/21, 09:13 - Kaustubh Kabra: Shyd SE kaise padhaya tha bhul gaye online paper tha isliye mcqs me hogaya offline theory paper rahata to lagte the
19/08/21, 09:13 - Prarthana Aissms: Ha agreed
19/08/21, 09:13 - vincent comp 1st: Mai pehle se Ds bol raha hu
19/08/21, 09:13 - Aditya Aissms: nahi toh dono sem me theory hogi
19/08/21, 09:13 - vincent comp 1st: Ya exactly
19/08/21, 09:14 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Google se hi leneka bol rahi hai toh spm lelo
19/08/21, 09:14 - +91 70580 11691: But ds chi more complicated than iot
19/08/21, 09:14 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Jisko karne hai courses lelo
19/08/21, 09:14 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: +1
19/08/21, 09:14 - Prarthana Aissms: Os se related hai kya ds? Os imp hai coz, ds sikh ke fayda hoga kuch?
19/08/21, 09:15 - vincent comp 1st: SPM kaafi boring hai
19/08/21, 09:15 - vincent comp 1st: Khud se padh sakte
19/08/21, 09:15 - Kaustubh Kabra: Dekho google se hi course karna he to yaha pe bhi aur google se bhi same course karo na...
19/08/21, 09:16 - vincent comp 1st: Ds lagta hai for understanding System Design
19/08/21, 09:16 - +91 77096 34674: Isko sirf SPM hi aata hai
19/08/21, 09:16 - vincent comp 1st: Jo job interviews mai pucha jaata hai
19/08/21, 09:16 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Spm hi lelo

Iot and spm me se bol rahi hai
19/08/21, 09:16 - +91 77096 34674: Manipulate karri baccho ko😂
19/08/21, 09:16 - +91 77096 34674: Ma'am
19/08/21, 09:16 - +91 70580 11691: 😂
19/08/21, 09:16 - Onasvee Banarse: 😂😂
19/08/21, 09:16 - Prarthana Aissms: Mam ka pehele se spm decided hai
19/08/21, 09:17 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: +1
19/08/21, 09:17 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Wo starting se hi spm pe stress Kar rahi hai
19/08/21, 09:17 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Iot and spm ke beech me hi choose karne ko bol rahi hai
19/08/21, 09:17 - Kaustubh Kabra: Computing kam me nahi aayega konsa nasha kar rahi mam
19/08/21, 09:18 - Prarthana Aissms: Btw agar abhi spm liya na toh elective 2 me bhi isse related subject hi lena padega. Mam ne abhi bola na ki spm loge toh elective 2 me architecture something le lege
19/08/21, 09:18 - vincent comp 1st: Ha na
19/08/21, 09:18 - Kaustubh Kabra: Online hi course karna he to ds pe karte aur yaha pe bhi ds lo
19/08/21, 09:18 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Lekin sab karenge kya ds ka course!?
19/08/21, 09:18 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Online
19/08/21, 09:18 - Aditya Aissms: Dono Elective thoery nahi chahiye
19/08/21, 09:19 - +91 70580 11691: Then why not iot
19/08/21, 09:19 - Kaustubh Kabra: Tum hi bol rahe li aalag se karna hoga to karo
19/08/21, 09:19 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: See.
Iot and spm se lelo I don't have a problem.

Ds thoda complicated ho jayega.
19/08/21, 09:19 - Kaustubh Kabra: 2 course karne se acha el hi course karo na jo aghe bhi kam aayega
19/08/21, 09:20 - +91 70580 11691: +1
19/08/21, 09:20 - Kaustubh Kabra: Muje spm se problem he baki kuch bhi chalega
19/08/21, 09:20 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Haan toh jisko alag se karna hai karo

But iske chakkar me backlog toh nahi aana chahiye na

Toh idhar paper ke liye easy wala lelo
19/08/21, 09:20 - Kaustubh Kabra: Theory subject me back bhi lag sakta
19/08/21, 09:20 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Ds ka course hi karna hai toh elective me Kyu lena hai
19/08/21, 09:20 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Bruh😂😂😂😂
19/08/21, 09:20 - +91 75073 85028: Arey isko kon pucha aapko kya aacha lagra hai😂😂😂
19/08/21, 09:21 - Onasvee Banarse: See IoT is like microprocessor or deld it needs practical knowledge 
And in this condition we can't  have practical
19/08/21, 09:21 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Usne spm personally decide kiya hao
19/08/21, 09:21 - Kaustubh Kabra: Online exam huyi to hojayega offline huyi to lagege
19/08/21, 09:21 - Prarthana Aissms: Are aise nahi...see os placements me kaafi useful hota hai. So ds karke fayda hi hoga i think
19/08/21, 09:21 - +91 77096 34674: Online honewali
19/08/21, 09:21 - +91 70580 11691: If choice is between ds n iot then i think iot is simple in compare to ds
19/08/21, 09:21 - Harsh Shah: Nai
Ye sem offline hogi
19/08/21, 09:22 - +91 75073 85028: 50-50
19/08/21, 09:22 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Iske chances hai bahaut
19/08/21, 09:22 - vincent comp 1st: Bhai abhi tak announce mahi hua hai
19/08/21, 09:22 - Kaustubh Kabra: 5th ho jayegi 6th me kya karga bro
19/08/21, 09:22 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: +1
19/08/21, 09:22 - vincent comp 1st: Iot ka pracs dekho. Online kaafi difficult jaayega
19/08/21, 09:23 - +91 77096 34674: Toh jabtak easy wale mil rahe hai...kar lete hai
19/08/21, 09:23 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: +1
19/08/21, 09:23 - +91 70580 11691: Exam online ya offline ye baad main decide kar sakte hai😂 
mam spm confirm kare usi phele apn decide kare😅😅☺️
19/08/21, 09:23 - +91 75073 85028: +1
19/08/21, 09:23 - Kaustubh Kabra: Kya logic he bhai dono same subject lege to hi fayada
19/08/21, 09:24 - Kaustubh Kabra: Spm nahi guys pls
19/08/21, 09:24 - vincent comp 1st: Ha na bhai kaise phaltu subject hai vo
19/08/21, 09:24 - Prarthana Aissms: Elective 2 me there are better subjects...toh voh lene dena chaiye mam ne. Abhi spm liya toh baad me maybe spm related hi lena padega
19/08/21, 09:24 - Harsh Shah: Jo 6th sem ke elective hai unke liye 5th sem ke elective prerequisite hai
Toh abhi jo subject liye na toh next sem main uska hi advance lena padega
19/08/21, 09:24 - vincent comp 1st: Usse bhi accha luch aur lelo
19/08/21, 09:24 - +91 77096 34674: +1
19/08/21, 09:24 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Dekho ......jo bhi subject loge
End me apne hi lagenge.

Toh soch samajhke lo
19/08/21, 09:25 - +91 70580 11691: +1
19/08/21, 09:25 - +91 70580 11691: Lec khatam hone main 5 min hai...mam ko bol kal ke lec main confirm karke bolti aap ko
19/08/21, 09:26 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Diye toh humko isse pehle kaafi din the

Kuch ghanta ukhaad paye hum
19/08/21, 09:26 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Select toh waise bhi nahi hua
19/08/21, 09:27 - swapnil aissms computer 1st: Ds lete h na
Wo os related h
19/08/21, 09:27 - +91 70580 11691: But aj ek toh confirm hai hci nahi hai discussion main
19/08/21, 09:27 - vincent comp 1st: Next sem ka software modelli g and arch and cloud computing accha hai
19/08/21, 09:28 - +91 77096 34674: Spm lelo guys
19/08/21, 09:28 - Prarthana Aissms: Guys elective 2 ke sab subjects related nahi hai elective 1 se. Only cloud computing has a prerequisite of elective 1.
19/08/21, 09:29 - vincent comp 1st: Bro spm leke waste karenge ek subj bas
19/08/21, 09:29 - Harsh Shah: Sab related hai 
Check it properly
19/08/21, 09:29 - vincent comp 1st: Usme exam ke liye padhne layak kuch nahi hai
19/08/21, 09:29 - Aditya Aissms: IOT ke practicals net me aaram se mil jayenge
19/08/21, 09:30 - Prarthana Aissms: Look into prerequisites
19/08/21, 09:30 - +91 77096 34674: I agree to this...lekin yeh log to waise bhi kuch nahi sikhane Wale toh isse better hai ki faltu subject le lete hai aur baki jisko jo karna hai woh bahar se kar lena......vaise bhi academics placement mein to koi dekhega bhi nahi
19/08/21, 09:31 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Makes sense.
19/08/21, 09:31 - +91 77096 34674: Aur faltu knowledge milne wala hai to faltu subject ka lelo na
19/08/21, 09:31 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: But then....
19/08/21, 09:31 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Theek hai tum logg hi dekh lo
19/08/21, 09:31 - Prarthana Aissms: Ha but khud hi padhna hai toh ds padhte coz ds is related to os and os is important in placements
19/08/21, 09:31 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: I'm outta this.
19/08/21, 09:32 - +91 77096 34674: Yeh bhi thik hai
19/08/21, 09:32 - Prarthana Aissms: Aage cloud computing bhi le sakte then
19/08/21, 09:32 - vincent comp 1st: Ya exactly
19/08/21, 09:32 - vincent comp 1st: Not only OS but for System design
19/08/21, 09:33 - vincent comp 1st: System design kya hai chahiye tho Gaurav Sen ka Youtube Channel dekh lo
19/08/21, 09:34 - vincent comp 1st: Amazon jaise companies low level systemdesign puch rahe hai aaj kal
19/08/21, 09:37 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Dekho, tumko online exam hui toh bhi convenient chahiye

Offline exam ke liye bhi convenience chahiye

Yeh possible nahi hone wala.
19/08/21, 09:38 - +91 70580 11691: +1
19/08/21, 09:38 - Kaustubh Kabra: Kuch bhi lo ab sirf spm mat lo
19/08/21, 09:38 - Prarthana Aissms: Achha have a look at this
19/08/21, 09:38 - Prarthana Aissms: Subject - use - easy/medium/hard to study

1. Spm - not much useful, elective 2 will be wasted too - easy to score (if online)/ hectic(if offline)
2. Ds - for placements (OS related), can choose elective 2 as cloud computing - medium
3. IOT - only if you are interested in hardware/ for software people, no use - medium
19/08/21, 09:41 - vincent comp 1st: Ye lo for DS, MIT lecture link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQP8WApzIQQ&list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-WkMbsvGQk9_UB&index=1
19/08/21, 09:41 - vincent comp 1st: Sab dekh lo just ek baar skip karte karte
19/08/21, 09:41 - vincent comp 1st: Agar accha lage tho hi lena
19/08/21, 09:42 - vincent comp 1st: This message was deleted
19/08/21, 09:42 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Wohi I was about to say

DS le liya
And kisi ek ko bhi accha nahi laga

Toh tujhpe aayega
19/08/21, 09:42 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: 👀👀
19/08/21, 09:42 - vincent comp 1st: Phir mere pe inzaam mat lagana ki difficult ho gaya
19/08/21, 09:42 - vincent comp 1st: Thik hai phir IOT lete
19/08/21, 09:42 - vincent comp 1st: SPM bilkul nahi
19/08/21, 09:43 - vincent comp 1st: Sirf time waste hai vo
19/08/21, 09:43 - Kaustubh Kabra: Vohi kuch bhi lo spm nahi
19/08/21, 09:43 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Tum tumhare hisaab se dekho

Because koi agar bolega ki xyz subject lo toh baadme wo usi pe backfire ho jayega
19/08/21, 09:43 - vincent comp 1st: Mere recommendation
1. DS 
2. IOT
3. HCI
Spm bilkul nahi
19/08/21, 09:44 - +91 95520 72836: Yaar koi bhi lo
But aisa choose karo 
Jo easily sabko samjh aaye
Jyada complicate subject mat lo bas
19/08/21, 09:45 - Sunit: Toc nhi hora??
19/08/21, 09:45 - Aditya Aissms: IOT interesting hai but kaam jada nahi aayega sabko, but DS gate and placement me bhi kaam aayega
19/08/21, 09:45 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Dikh nahi raha
19/08/21, 09:45 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: 👀
19/08/21, 09:48 - +91 70580 11691: Why dont create a poll between ds n iot
Anyway we are going to select between them only
19/08/21, 09:49 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Isse pehle ki ma'am bole
"Tumse na ho payega"

Aur spm declare kar de

Decide karlo aaj ke din me hi
19/08/21, 09:49 - +91 70580 11691: +1
19/08/21, 09:50 - vincent comp 1st: 👍🏻
19/08/21, 09:50 - Onasvee Banarse: 👍🏻
19/08/21, 09:50 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Poll me toh last time DS ko kisine vote nahi kiya tha

Sab IOT and HCI me confused the

Lekin last me DS aa hi gaya.
19/08/21, 09:50 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Bharosa hai??
19/08/21, 09:51 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Karne wale honge logg genuinely vote, toh hi poll lelo

Warna wohi 20-30 logg vote karenge

Baadme kuch aur aayega

Aise na karo aap
19/08/21, 09:51 - Kaustubh Kabra: HCI was 1st choice and ds 2nd
19/08/21, 09:52 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: .
19/08/21, 09:52 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Here. Dekhlo last poll ka
19/08/21, 09:52 - Kaustubh Kabra: It's my opinion
19/08/21, 09:53 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Accha. Haanji

04/12/21, 19:43 - +91 99233 42020: We have done almost all of the work 
Only some minor stuff remains
If you want to contribute then DM asap or else you won't be considered a part of the group for the final presentation.
04/12/21, 20:51 - +91 97666 44429: Respected Sir/madam,
         This msg is regarding the offline submission issues that students are facing. We are ready to submit all the assignments , lab manuals , mini project and other project work within the given date. But submissions to be offline is not feasible for each and everyone of us. Since we are currently placed in different states and cities hence we aren't able to come back in Pune even if we want to. There are no means to travel back for submission to be offline as transport facilities and hostel facilities are not available to many. Also many students who are not having 2 doses of Covid vaccine are not comfortable to migrate to Pune due to risk of new covid variant.
    Please allow us to do the submission online. We will make sure to get everything completed before hand. 
    Hope you would kindly understand our situation. 

Thank you

05/12/21, 14:22 - +91 97666 44429: Respected Sir/madam,
         This message is regarding the offline submission issues that students are facing. But submissions to be offline is not feasible for each and everyone of us. Since we are currently placed in different states and cities hence we aren't able to come back in Pune even if we want to, Parents of us students are hesitant to allow us to travel all the way to college. There are no living facility or hostels at the present moment available to many. Also many students who are not having 2 doses of Covid vaccine are not comfortable to migrate to Pune due to risk of new covid variant.

We request for a solution of the problem us students are facing.

Hope you would kindly understand our situation.

08/12/21, 13:51 - +91 90968 28823: Guys CR kon hai apne class ka?
08/12/21, 13:53 - Prarthana Aissms: Ha mai hi hu
08/12/21, 14:21 - Prarthana Aissms: Guys, I had a talk with our gfm.

1. Viva ka jo schedule aaya hai, ye sab mock practicals hai. Final practicals are after 15th and they can be offline (not yet decided).

2. Prelim 10 baje rahegi. Around 12pm link schedule hogi for mock practicals.

3. Regarding submissions, mam said that offline hi hoge submissions. And jo log out of pune hai, they can come later on during final practicals (if it's offline) and handover their files. 

4. If we want online mode for submissions, we need to go in college and talk to hod ma'am or principal sir. Toh jo log Pune me hai, they can go and request for online mode for submissions, considering the covid situations and the distance factor. Gfm ne unke taraf se try kiya and mail bhi check kiya hod mam ne, but usse kuch hoga nahi. Jo log Pune me hai, unko hi college jaa ke baat karni padegi.

5. Spos ke mock practicals me we only have to execute the program and viva nahi hone wala. Baaki subjects ka bhi kuch bola nahi hai.
08/12/21, 14:24 - +91 96077 56020: Ok
08/12/21, 14:25 - +91 95520 72836: Thanks for informing:)
08/12/21, 14:31 - Prarthana Aissms: 6. Spos ke last mock me jinka program execution ho gaya hai, unn logo ne abhi wale mock practicals attend nahi kiye toh bhi chalega. (This is ONLY for SPOS).
But still on the safer side, join kar lena and mam ko bol dena.
08/12/21, 19:34 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Anyone from here is from Pune?
08/12/21, 19:34 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: I was thinking of either
1) send a mail to hod and principal regarding making practicals online
And
2) some people can go and meet the hod as well.
08/12/21, 19:36 - +91 77096 34674: Yes If anyone stays in pune do reply...
08/12/21, 19:36 - Sunit: +1
08/12/21, 19:36 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Karna toh kuch padega because nai kiya toh sabke practicals offline hone hai.
08/12/21, 19:37 - +91 77096 34674: Exactly
08/12/21, 19:37 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Sabko saath me marna padega fir

But ab mai Pune me nahi hu toh meeting ka toh dekhlo koi
08/12/21, 19:38 - Sunit: Ha mam ko request karo for online practical exams

08/12/21, 19:39 - +91 77096 34674: Yes
08/12/21, 19:39 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: And jo karna hai thoda fast karo

Principal sir ko saree points explain kiye...and he totally agrees for all our points but as per circular they are taking the proper care while taking the exams offline. 

And as per our request principal sir ne word diya he ki agar AISSMS COE college online practical exam lega...toh we will also shift to that mode....
 
Conclusion : 
On making conclusion of stuff
We requested for the delay of the practical exam ..so he granted that permission and the practicals will be from 20dec onwards. (Not yet confirmed , but Hod mam will look after it on departmental level )


If we got some news from COE college for online practical there are hopes💯✋🏻..

And truly we tried our level best to convince.....

They said ki udhar also teachers don't have a problem with online practicals and are telling their respective hod/principal the same

But final decision is yet to be taken. 

They said even they are pushing for online exams, but final decision remains in the hands of the principal.

10/12/21, 15:34 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: <Media omitted>
10/12/21, 15:36 - +91 97666 44429: Coe walo ke toh online hi hai but - Principal be like, "Chutiya banaya bada maza aaya"

We called shilpa ma'am
She .... I think doesn't know ki principal sir ke saath baat hui hai. 
She said ki HOD ko bolo and cut the call

Amrapali ma'am said ki wo out of town thi
Unhe nai pata

Toh ab subah I think someone has to call HOD and tell her ki principal sir se yeh yeh baat hui hai
10/12/21, 20:06 - +91 95955 26856: Sabke saamne ha bola tha principal ne ki 20th se chalu karenge
10/12/21, 20:06 - +91 95955 26856: Backstab karre
10/12/21, 20:06 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: I have given up.
10/12/21, 20:06 - +91 95955 26856: Each and every hod was present over there apart from 5 students
10/12/21, 20:07 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: I think Jo Shilpa ma'am ne dala hai timetable, she hasn't cross checked with the hod. 

She's just put it... Usko mila hai isiliye
10/12/21, 20:07 - Himanshu Bhedale fe b1: It has signature
10/12/21, 20:08 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: Yeah yea.

10/12/21, 22:05 - +91 99233 42020: Nope
Afternoon me 2-3:30 Shilpa ma'am aur hod tt ke baare me discuss karre the
Uske baad Shilpa ma'am ne banaya tt
10/12/21, 22:07 - +91 99233 42020: And uske baad jab mai submission ke liye gaya DBMS ka
To itna sadistic way me boli ki sab ka evaluation ab ache se karungi 15 tarik
End me sabko yehi aana hai jo karna hai karo
10/12/21, 22:09 - +91 99233 42020: To ab Shilpa ma'am se expect bhi mat karo ki she'll co-operate
Na abhi aur na practical exams ke time pe 
She's actually looking forward to torchering us
10/12/21, 22:09 - Himanshu Bhedale fe b1: I feel the same
10/12/21, 22:09 - +91 80801 46257: 😥🤯

10/12/21, 22:12 - Akash: Dont forget the Times new roman font😂
10/12/21, 22:12 - Aniket Chopde Aissms: 😂
10/12/21, 22:12 - +91 99233 42020: SPOS and CNS ka koi issue nahi hai 
Dono ke teachers co-operate karte hai 
Better hai ki DBMS ki padhai karo bc 4 din
And 15 ko uska pura jo ye ghamand hai na wo utarvao and tab usko bolo ki kar na ab evaluation bc
10/12/21, 22:13 - Onasvee Banarse: Text sire 12

10/12/21, 22:14 - Harsh Aswar: Kisiko kuch idea hai ki Practs ka format kya hone wala?

10/12/21, 22:17 - Onasvee Banarse: See CNS maam knows she only taught some topic form unit 3 
So only one unit 

She can't expect us to give viva on all 6 unit in detail
10/12/21, 22:18 - Durvesh mahajan comp 1st: 💯
10/12/21, 22:18 - Kaustubh Kabra: 🙌
10/12/21, 22:18 - +91 70580 11691: Yaa..and she knows how much we know and we studied
10/12/21, 22:18 - +91 95520 72836: Haa cns mai bhi bas 3 unit ka imp concept karo
Aur mam ko bhi request karo ki usi pe viva le
10/12/21, 22:18 - +91 95520 72836: I guess mam maan jayegi
10/12/21, 22:19 - +91 70580 11691: Sirf dbms ki mam ko puchna hoga wo kya lengi aur kaise lengi
10/12/21, 22:19 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: sorry to interrupt you guys but all I know is DBMS ki bai poori pagal hai

10/12/21, 22:19 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: she does not cooperate
10/12/21, 22:19 - +91 70580 11691: 😑😐

10/12/21, 22:22 - Shruti Mehta Fe B Div: Clg labs ke most of the computers pe mysql and eclipse installed bhi nai hai
10/12/21, 22:22 - Akash: True
10/12/21, 22:22 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: F
10/12/21, 22:22 - +91 91128 86325: Noice
10/12/21, 22:22 - +91 91128 86325: Yaha se shurvat hai
10/12/21, 22:23 - Shruti Mehta Fe B Div: So mayb we can bring our laptops....
10/12/21, 22:23 - +91 95520 72836: Haa yaar mam ko karte hai request 
Ki code run karke dikha denge 
And logic bhi bata denge code ka
Bas wo practical pehle hi bata de kobsa perform karna hai
10/12/21, 22:23 - Harsh Shah: Don't do this
Ma'am already chill hai
Sab txt karke pareshan mat karo
Already leave pe hai
10/12/21, 22:23 - +91 99758 25922: Exactly becoz we have no idea ki vo kaise lenge practicals kuch toh batana chahiye
10/12/21, 22:23 - +91 95520 72836: Yaar phir koi Ek mam se request karo
10/12/21, 22:23 - +91 70580 11691: Aise bol nahi sakti...practical exam ki liye wo install kar lengi...
Last time he hod mam ne cns ki mam ko bola tha jo software chahiye wo install karava lo
10/12/21, 22:24 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: ek nai bhai
class ki taraf se karna padega
10/12/21, 22:24 - +91 95520 72836: Haa correct
10/12/21, 22:25 - Onasvee Banarse: See If we go offline this time 


Exam will mostly will be offline  . 
ACCORDING TO ME
10/12/21, 22:25 - Tanishka Shinde Aissms: +1
10/12/21, 22:26 - +91 93079 79159: +1
10/12/21, 22:27 - +91 99233 42020: Bhai pune me 50 college hai
Usme se apna hi 1 college hai jo offline lera 
To ye nahi lagta meko
10/12/21, 22:27 - Akash: True
10/12/21, 22:27 - +91 95520 72836: Ha pehle CNS wali mam se koi oral k questions ka set mang lo
Jo ki 3 units par based ho
10/12/21, 22:27 - +91 93079 79159: Voi toh
10/12/21, 22:27 - Onasvee Banarse: Principal wants autonomy
10/12/21, 22:27 - +91 97666 44429: Am I the only one jo soch raha tha...Nahi jayenge 15 ko ya doubting tt, aur koi jayega hi nahi toh ghanta kuch nahi hoga?
10/12/21, 22:27 - Harsh Shah: See according to me
Spos ki ma'am already chill hai
Toh unko ek bhi txt mat karo
Kyuki ma'am leave pe hai
Vaha mat pareshan karo
Ma'am kar legi co-operate

CNS ki ma'am ko bhi puch ke kuch faayda nai hai
Kyuki voh nayi hai
File submission ke time bhi unhone hame hi pucha ki baaki teachers kaise lere hai
So voh gfm ke according hi chalegi

Aur dbms toh chod hi do
Apne ko khud se karna padega

So according to me don't trouble teachers by texting them about viva and practical

Hostelites aur baaki sab online ke liye puch sakte but don't ask them about practical and mock 
Kyuki agar voh chide toh apne ko hi difficult hoga

Jyaada se jyaada CNS ke ma'am ko koi bhi ek txt kar do baaki kisi ma'am ko practical ke related mat karo
10/12/21, 22:28 - +91 99233 42020: <Media omitted>
10/12/21, 22:28 - Harsh Shah: So let's try ki online ho....but don't trouble teachers regarding practicals and vivas
It will be difficult for us
DBMS ke ma'am ko apan ne try kiya tha soft copy ke liye and it backfired on us
10/12/21, 22:28 - Durvesh mahajan comp 1st: Ha yaar bol sakte hai problems ke bare me
10/12/21, 22:29 - +91 95520 72836: Ha toh CNS wali mam se itna toh mang hi sakte hai
10/12/21, 22:30 - Harsh Shah: I'll talk to ma'am tomorrow
10/12/21, 22:30 - Harsh Shah: Cns ma'am
10/12/21, 22:30 - +91 77560 34099: Ha ye kar sakte hai na
10/12/21, 22:31 - +91 95520 72836: Yaar hum sab jante hai
Hum kitna hi bole ki mat jao koi
But koi na koi pakka jayega
And teachers aur bhi gussa ho jayenge
10/12/21, 22:31 - +91 70580 11691: Ye mat karo...
Wo log aur bhi chid jayengi... teachers se baat karki kuch hoga toh dekh lo...
But aise bunk karngi toh apne difficults increase ho jayengi..
10/12/21, 22:31 - +91 95520 72836: Yeah correct
10/12/21, 22:32 - +91 72761 24412: +1
10/12/21, 22:32 - Durvesh mahajan comp 1st: Agar Sab Students Offline practicals ko attend karte hai to 100% final exam bhi offline hoga.
10/12/21, 22:32 - +91 70580 11691: Nahi..ye abhi decide nahi hai...phele B.E ki exam ka dekhngi wo kaise hota hai baad main apna
10/12/21, 22:32 - +91 95520 72836: Yaar phir principle sir se request karo online practical k liye
Aur aaj jo bhi decision huye uska kya hua bol ke

Sabse pehle try yahi karo ki online ho
10/12/21, 22:33 - +91 70580 11691: Haa..
10/12/21, 22:33 - +91 97666 44429: Teachers ne hands up sabse pehle kar diya tha sab apne upar ke authority se baat karne ko kehti hai toh point hi kya hai?
10/12/21, 22:33 - +91 93079 79159: Vai toh...
10/12/21, 22:33 - +91 95520 72836: Yaar bolo ki aaj wapas omicron k Patients mile hai
Isiliye safe nahi hai
10/12/21, 22:34 - Kaustubh Kabra: Spos ko ek dalo ki aap pahale se sab ko assign kar sakte kya practicals aur cns ke mam ko ek text dalo ki viva ke questions bank kuch de sakte kya bas ek hi dal spam karoge teachers ko to irritate hoge aapne ko problems dege....
10/12/21, 22:34 - +91 95520 72836: Kafi bacche out of pune se aate hai
Wo bas 4-5 din k liye kaha stay karenge
10/12/21, 22:34 - +91 72761 24412: Ha omicron ke vajah se parents nahi man rhe aisa bolte n
10/12/21, 22:35 - +91 93079 79159: Vooi toh
10/12/21, 22:35 - +91 95520 72836: Ha correct
10/12/21, 22:35 - +91 93079 79159: Yrr dekho agr sbka... Parents agr call krta ha... Hod ko
10/12/21, 22:35 - Durvesh mahajan comp 1st: Maine jab kal GFM ko online ka bola to wo sirf itna boli ki meeting me hi final hoga. I can't do anything.... Issliye Sab HOD ya phir Principal ke hi hath me hai
10/12/21, 22:35 - +91 95955 26856: Yeh nai hoga
10/12/21, 22:35 - +91 93079 79159: Omicron se related b bolta ha
10/12/21, 22:35 - Kaustubh Kabra: CR if you can do pls or decide who is doing...
10/12/21, 22:35 - Durvesh mahajan comp 1st: Correct
10/12/21, 22:36 - +91 93079 79159: I agree
10/12/21, 22:36 - +91 93079 79159: Exactly.. Ma toh j&k se hu yrr
10/12/21, 22:36 - +91 70580 11691: Wo log bas..idar se udhar baat ghuma rahi hai..
10/12/21, 22:37 - +91 95520 72836: Yaar ab baat bas HOD aur principle sir se karne ka try karte hai
Bcoz we all know inka hi decision final hoga
10/12/21, 22:37 - +91 72761 24412: Parents ke grp pr bolne ko keh sakte hm apne parents ko
10/12/21, 22:37 - +91 95520 72836: Toh in logo ko manane ki koshish karo 
Ki online le
10/12/21, 22:37 - Durvesh mahajan comp 1st: Bolte hai ki Parents allow nahi kar rahe hai Omicron Cases ke darr se. Puch lo parents se agar chahiye to...
10/12/21, 22:38 - +91 95520 72836: Parents group par sab apne apne parents ke number se message daal do
10/12/21, 22:38 - +91 93079 79159: Hnn
10/12/21, 22:38 - +91 72761 24412: Yes... Itna to sab kr sakte he
10/12/21, 22:38 - +91 95520 72836: Aur question karo ki agar humare baccho ko omicron hua toh uski responsibility kon lega
10/12/21, 22:39 - +91 95520 72836: Aur wo itne din kaha stay karenge
10/12/21, 22:39 - +91 93079 79159: Exactly
10/12/21, 22:39 - Harsh Shah: Ye tum mat bolo
Parents ko bolne lagao
10/12/21, 22:39 - +91 95520 72836: Aur sath hi mai
Unke khane ki responsibility kon lega
10/12/21, 22:39 - +91 93079 79159: Yess
10/12/21, 22:39 - Kaustubh Kabra: Parents grp pe sirf admin msg kar sakta he....
10/12/21, 22:40 - +91 93079 79159: Han han students baat nhi krna asa parents kr skhta ha...
10/12/21, 22:40 - +91 95520 72836: Toh parents group par parents ko kyu add kiya hai 
Jab wo message hi nahi kar sakte
10/12/21, 22:40 - Durvesh mahajan comp 1st: College ko agar 10-12 bhi parents ke call aa gaye na to pakka kam ho sakta hai.

10/12/21, 22:55 - +91 95520 72836: Call karne ke liye
10/12/21, 22:55 - Kaustubh Kabra: I request all the parents to raise a concern about this decision as early as possible!
10/12/21, 22:55 - Kaustubh Kabra: How student will stay at pune witout any room or hostel in  short time it is not possible
10/12/21, 22:55 - Kaustubh Kabra: Many of us are reluctant to send our children back to pune, with this new variant of covid, I disagree with this decision, colleges should revise their decision.
10/12/21, 22:55 - Kaustubh Kabra: अगदी बरोबर आहे, मुलांना पाठवायला काहीच हरकत नाही, परंतु ते राहतील कुठे? आणि ओमेयक्रोन या नवीन विषाणू बाबत आरोग्य व पोलीस विभागाकडून प्राप्त सूचनांचे कुठलीही शहनिशा न  करता, होस्टेल ची सुविधा नसताना अशा प्रकारचे निर्णय विद्यार्थ्यांवर लादणे  अन्याय कारक आहेत, याबाबत ग्रुपवर मॅसेज टाकल्यानंतर कुठलीही माहिती न देणे व अगदी वेळेवर अशाप्रकारचे निर्णय घेऊन पालकांना न कळविता परस्पर विद्यार्थ्यांना कळविणे ही बाब अडचणी निर्माण करणाऱ्या आहेत, माझी विनंती आहे, ऑफलाईन व ऑनलाइन विद्यार्थ्यांना इच्छुक पर्याय असावा. नाहीतर होस्टेल ची सुविधा द्यावी व पूर्णपणे ऑफलाइन घ्यावे असे माझे पालक यानात्याने विनंती आहे, प्राचार्य सरांना,🙏🙏🙏
10/12/21, 22:55 - Kaustubh Kabra: Totally disagree with this decision. Why was this decision taken so late and without consulting parents and students?Since all the lecture and practicals were conducted online, exams should also be taken online for all students.
10/12/21, 22:55 - Kaustubh Kabra: Totally disagree.
As lectures and practicals were taken online exams should be taken online itself.
10/12/21, 22:56 - +91 95955 26856: Second shift ke log bhi karre

Take at least one person with you.

3.we are not getting any room in 2,3 days before exam and some  hostels are not opened yet.and from 400km how can I updown everyday ???is it possible??
3.Omicron patients are increasing day by day and there is high risk because i am not fully vaccinated.so in this situation my parents are in fear and how they can give me the permission for offline exam ?because no one is taking responsibility of students .they just doing compulsion to them ...

They know very well what they're doing. 

They have their own motives. 
Acche ya bure, yeh bhagwan jaane. 

If they're a bunch of psychos, one day it's going to come back to them.

14/12/21, 14:59 - Prarthana Aissms: Everyone please add one LP-1 practical ( *except CPU Scheduling*) of your choice to this list. Make sure to get it done before 6PM today, else you'll be alloted any random practical.
